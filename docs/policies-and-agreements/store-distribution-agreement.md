Each Monthly Report will contain activity for the current month as well as any Net Revenue adjustments for prior months reported by payment processors in the current month. Unless mutually agreed by Mezon and Developer in a separate written agreement executed by both parties, Mezon will pay to Developer ninety percent (90%) of the Net Revenue on the Monthly Report (the “License Fees”) within thirty (30) days after the Monthly Report is published, in no event later than sixty (60) days from the end of the of the calendar month covered by the Monthly Report.

Developer may change the price for any Apps or App-Related Content at any time, at Developer’s discretion, upon notice to Mezon. As agent or commissionaire for Developer, Mezon shall be solely responsible for the collection of all prices payable by Mezon Store Account Owners for Apps acquired by those Mezon Store Account Owners.

6.2 **Taxes.** In the event that any remittance made by Mezon to Developer is subject to any VAT, the full amount of such VAT shall be solely for the account of Developer, and will not reduce Mezon's fee amount to which Mezon is entitled on such transaction. To the extent required under applicable law, Mezon will deduct the full amount of such VAT from the amount owed to Developer, and will pay the full amount withheld to the competent tax authorities. Mezon will use commercially reasonably efforts to obtain, and to furnish to Developer, copies of official tax receipts or similar evidence of payment, confirming payment of such VAT to the competent tax authorities. Developer will indemnify and hold Mezon harmless against any and all claims by any competent tax authorities for any underpayment of any VAT, and any penalties and/or interest thereon, including, but not limited to, underpayments attributable to any erroneous claim or representation by Developer as to its entitlement to, or any disqualification of Developer for, the benefit of a reduced rate of withholding tax..

6.3 **Minimum Monthly Payment and Negative Amounts.** In the event amounts due to Developer for a given month do not exceed one hundred U.S. dollars ($100), Mezon may elect to not remit payment for that month, and may instead accumulate payments due until they exceed one hundred U.S. dollars ($100) as of the end of a future monthly payment cycle. Also, to the extent that the payment calculation in a Monthly Report results in a negative amount, that negative amount will be carried forward and deducted from any future amounts otherwise payable to Developer by Mezon under this Agreement.

6.4 **Multi-Platform Apps.** To the extent that Developer has submitted to Mezon Store versions of an App for multiple operating systems (for example, a Mac version, and a Windows version) such versions shall be sold together as a single "hybrid" App unit on Mezon Store. Accordingly, a Mac version of any App, a Windows version of an App, and a Linux version of an App shall not be considered separate sales when calculating the payments due to Developer hereunder.
