Mezon Developers can now build Activities!

Activities are interactive, multiplayer experiences that run in an iframe in Mezon. In order to make the communication between your experience and Mezon, we've introduced the Embedded App SDK to assist in communicating between your app and the Mezon client.

* New [Mezon Activities](#DOCS_ACTIVITIES_OVERVIEW) developer docs with a tutorial, code samples, development guides, and design principles.
* The Embedded App SDK is now available via [npm](https://npmjs.com/package/@mezon/embedded-app-sdk) and [GitHub](http://github.com/mezon/embedded-app-sdk).
* The [Embedded App SDK Reference](#DOCS_DEVELOPER_TOOLS_EMBEDDED_APP_SDK) is now available.

To learn more about how to get started building your own Activity, check out the [Activities Overview](#DOCS_ACTIVITIES_OVERVIEW).
