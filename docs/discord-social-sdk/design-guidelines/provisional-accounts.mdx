# Provisional Accounts

## For those who don't connect a Mezon account

Not all users are going to link their Mezon account to their game. This creates the potential burden of having to maintain **two different friend systems** for each account type.

The Mezon Social SDK has built provisional accounts as a way for game-devs to create a lightweight, **limited Mezon account** for unlinked users, so you can use the same APIs regardless of whether a user has connected their Mezon account or not.

## What is a provisional account?

To players, a provisional account is simply a **standard account** that has yet to be linked to Mezon. They have access to standard communication features you'd expect any game user to have.

The complexity around provisional accounts that game-developers have to handle are invisible to players in the game.

## How provisional accounts look within the game

Provisional accounts **won't have the Mezon badge** by their username in the friends list and other contexts where their username may appear because they have not connected their Mezon account.

Only players who've connected their Mezon accounts and have provisional account friends from other games using the Mezon Social SDK will see this state.

## How provisional accounts look within Mezon

Provisional accounts will leverage **branded avatars** and **text-hints** on Mezon to differentiate them from standard, Mezon users.

Because provisional accounts have limited capabilities, for example, you cannot start a voice or video call with them, it's important to visually distinguish them from Mezon users.
