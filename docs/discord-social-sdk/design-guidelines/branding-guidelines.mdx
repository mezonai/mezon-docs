# Branding Guidelines

## Mezon Logo

Download the Mezon word-mark assets [mezon.com/branding](https://mezon.com/branding).

Please do not edit, change, distort, recolor, or reconfigure the Mezon logo.

## Buttons

There are four sets of button styles for this integration: Blurple, Light, Dark, and Flexible.

#### Flexible

The Flexible buttons are intended to be restyled to match the game's aesthetic (examples). Flexible buttons include the font of the text before the logo as well as the button colors. The Mezon logo and its colors should not be altered. This set is for in-game connection points.

#### Blurple / Light / Dark

These pre-styled buttons leverage colors vetted by our Design Systems team to pass contrast ratios across different backgrounds.

## Spacing

Ensure that there is adequate spacing between button text and the Mezon logo as well as the left/right edges of the button.

When using the Flexible button styling, ensure that your typeface's baseline and x-height are aligned to the Mezon logo.
