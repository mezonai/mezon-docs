## Step 1: Create a Mezon Developer Team

Before you start, you'll need to create a developer team on the Mezon Developer Portal. This team will be used to manage your Mezon applications and SDK integrations.

If you already have a team configured, you can skip this step.

1. Create a developer team on the [Mezon Developer Portal](https://mezon.com/developers/teams).

Later, you can invite your team members to your new team to collaborate on your integration.

## Step 2: Create a Mezon Application

1. Create a new application on the [Mezon Developer Portal](https://mezon.com/developers/applications) and assign it to your team.
3. Add a redirect URL in the `OAuth2` tab:
   - For desktop applications: `http://127.0.0.1/callback` (this can be changed later).
   - See [`discordpp::Client::Authorize`](https://mezon.com/developers/docs/social-sdk/classdiscordpp_1_1Client.html#ace94a58e27545a933d79db32b387a468) for more details on setting up more advanced redirect URIs.
4. Enable the `Public Client` toggle in the `OAuth2` tab.

> **Note:** This guide requires enabling **Public Client** to allow you to get started with the SDK quickly. Most games will not want to ship as a public client. This setting should be reviewed by your team prior to releasing your game. [Learn more about public clients](#DOCS_DISCORD_SOCIAL_SDK_CORE_CONCEPTS/oauth2-client-types).

## Step 3: Enable Mezon Social SDK for Your App

Once you've created your Mezon application, you'll need to enable the Mezon Social SDK for it.

1. From the [Mezon Developer Portal](https://mezon.com/developers/applications), select your newly created application from Step 2.
2. In the left sidebar for your app, locate and click the `Getting Started` link under `Mezon Social SDK`.
3. Fill out the form to share details about your game.
4. Click `Submit` and the Social SDK will be enabled for your application.
5. Once enabled, you'll find binaries for the Social SDK under `Downloads`.
