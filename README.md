## Need some help?

Here are some Mezon servers that can help you out with everything Mezon API:

The [Official Mezon Developers server](https://mezon.gg/mezon-developers) has plenty of help channels with knowledgeable people and Mezon's developers to get you help with something you need, and get updates straight from the developers. However do keep in mind this is a purely on-topic server. If you are looking for a community, join the server below.

The [Unofficial Mezon API server](https://mezon.gg/mezon-api) is a common hangout for library and bot developers alike. It's a great starting point for those looking to dive in and learn bot-creation with the Mezon API.
